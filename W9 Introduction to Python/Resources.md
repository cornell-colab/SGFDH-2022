## Learning more about computers
[<i> Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software </i>(Petzold, 2000)](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/15145858)
> Using everyday objects and familiar language systems such as Braille and Morse code, author Charles Petzold weaves an illuminating narrative for anyone who’s ever wondered about the secret inner life of computers and other smart machines.

### Why do most computer languages count from zero?
There is [a famous paper](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html) written by [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) which covers many of the reasons why and explains how alternative choices have unpleasant tradeoffs.

### Unicode and text processing

- Vocabulary for text encodings - it's not typically necessary to know the details of each of these, but beware that encodings are often mislabeled, especially when they are very similar to each other.
  - [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
  - [ISO/IEC_8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1)
  - [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252)
  - [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
    - [Other Unicode encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings)

- Unicode even includes [languages we can't decipher](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10600.pdf)
