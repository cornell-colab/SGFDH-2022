## Learning more Python

[Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python (Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)

This resource, built with Jupyter Book and intended to engage learners with no prior programming experience, is a critical deep-dive into learning what text analysis is and how to perform a variety of text mining and analysis techniques. The workbook features Python code snippets and exercises to put skills into practice. There are also resources for analyzing texts in non-English languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese and Danish.

## Learning more about computers
[<i> Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software </i>(Petzold, 2000)](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/15145858)
> Using everyday objects and familiar language systems such as Braille and Morse code, author Charles Petzold weaves an illuminating narrative for anyone who’s ever wondered about the secret inner life of computers and other smart machines.

### Why do most computer languages count from zero?
There is [a famous paper](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html) written by [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) which covers many of the reasons why and explains how alternative choices have unpleasant tradeoffs.

- Vocabulary for text encodings - it's not typically necessary to know the details of each of these, but beware that encodings are often mislabeled, especially when they are very similar to each other.
  - [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
  - [ISO/IEC_8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1)
  - [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252)
  - [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
    - [Other Unicode encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings)

- Unicode even includes [languages we can't decipher](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10600.pdf)
