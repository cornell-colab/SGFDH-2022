## Pivot Tables
Pivot tables summarize your dataset. Like OpenRefine, they are a tool for examining your data and getting to know it better, *as well as* to prepare your data for analysis through visualization or other methods. 

They’re especially useful for summarizing categorical data. Think of the columns in your metadata or data that contain text . There’s a good chance these are categorical data (e.g. *property, violence, sober, drinks heavily*). These words represent categories that your individual data items fall into.   

You can make pivot tables with any almost any spreadsheet software, including [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (free and open source), Google Sheets (free and proprietary), or MicrosoftOffice Excel (fee-based and proprietary; site licensed to the Cornell community).  

“Open source” means that the code is open to inspection and modification by anyone. “Free” means users don’t pay fees to use it.( * ) If you don’t already have a firm favorite among these software options, I’d recommend making your first pivot table with **Sheets**, whose user interface I find the simplest. It's easy to jump in and start playing. But above, you can find step-by-step instructions for making pivot tables with any of these software packages. 

*Whether or not a company charges a fee to use their software, it may require users to pay with their willingness to be subject to data surveillance, as in the case of both Google Sheets and MicrosoftOffice 365. LibreOffice does not collect data on users.*
