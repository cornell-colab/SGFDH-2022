# Tabular Data: Cleaning & Exploring  
  
### Before the Session

* **Download and Install** [OpenRefine 3.5.2](https://openrefine.org/download.html)  
Email Eliza with any problems or questions.  

* **Read** the catalog entries for [Eastern Penitentiary Admission Book A](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/22/) and [Eastern Peniterntiary Admission Book B](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/21/) in *The Magazine of Early American Datasets .*

* **Download the dataset Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv**  
This dataset is a combination of the two datasets that you just read about. 
1. Go to the folder for today's session and click on the link to Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv. A page will open, and you'll see a preview of the data table.  
2. Toward the upper-right, you'll see a button that says "Raw." RIGHT-click it and choose "Save Link As."  
3. Choose a place on your machine to store it. Add the file suffix .csv to the file name if your machine doesn't automatically add it. Download the file and keep it somewhere you can find it Wednesday morning. 

* **Read** Davis, H. (2019). "[A Dataset is a Worldview](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-dataset-is-a-worldview-5328216dd44d)," a blog post on *Towards Data Science*, a *Medium* vertical.  
This short post is about datasets used in machine learning. But the idea that a dataset reflects a worldview is just as relevant to your creation of metadata schema as it is to considering the data used in machine learning, and it should be good food for thought now as well as later.

* **Read** Onouha, M. (2016). "[On Missing Datasets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets)," documentation of a mixed media installation. And **View** [the photos of the installation on the artist's website](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets).  

* **Read** D'Ignazio, C. and L. Klein (2020). "[Chapter 3: What Gets Counted Counts](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/h1w0nbqp/release/3)," in *Data Feminism*, MIT Press.  
Note the brief discussion of *The Colored Conventions Project,* one of the projects I inclduded on Day 1's list of examples.
 

### During the Session  

[Boxnote of questions about the data](https://cornell.app.box.com/notes/819798134709)

### After the Session  
* *Optional* Play around a little more with Open Refine. Try to address (or partially address) some of the research questions in the [boxnotes](https://cornell.app.box.com/folder/164704232818), or use it with your own data. 

* **Post a Reflection**
Potential questions to consider:  
* What new questions, insights, or confusions did you generate during or after today's session?
* In what ways does your own project dataset reflect a worldview of your own, someone else's, or multiple other people's?
* What are some ways you may want to clean your current project dataset? How confident are you feeling about devising a strategy to do so? What else do you want to learn in order to design, clean, or process your dataset or databse?  

### OpenRefine Reference Material  
* [Official OpenRefine Documentation and Resources](https://openrefine.org/documentation.html)  
* [GREL Documentation](https://openrefine.org/documentation.html)  
* [GREL Recipes](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Recipes)  
These "recipes" show you how to use GREL, sometimes combined with regular expressions, to accomplish common tasks. Can be very helpful!  
* [Clustering in Depth](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth)  
In case you want to understand the differences between various clustering methods.  
  
### OpenRefine Tutorials  
* [Getting started with OpenRefine](http://thomaspadilla.org/dataprep/) by Thomas Padilla  
A thorough introduction and reference geared toward humanists; the example data set is a list of books.  
* [Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) by Seth van Hooland, Ruben Verborgh and Max De Wilde  
A detailed peer-reviewed tutorial published by *The Programming Historian*  
  
### Pivot Tables Reference Material
Pivot tables summarize your dataset. Like OpenRefine, they are a tool for examining your data and getting to know it better, *as well as* to prepare your data for analysis through visualization or other methods. 

They’re especially useful for summarizing categorical data. Think of the columns in your metadata or data that contain text . There’s a good chance these are categorical data (e.g. *property, violence, sober, drinks heavily*). These words represent categories that your individual data items fall into.   

You can make pivot tables with any almost any spreadsheet software, including [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (free and open source), Google Sheets (free and proprietary), or MicrosoftOffice Excel (fee-based and proprietary; site licensed to the Cornell community).  

“Open source” means that the code is open to inspection and modification by anyone. “Free” means users don’t pay fees to use it.( * ) If you don’t already have a firm favorite among these software options, I’d recommend making your first pivot table with **Sheets**, whose user interface I find the simplest. It's easy to jump in and start playing. But above, you can find step-by-step instructions for making pivot tables with any of these software packages. 

*Whether or not a company charges a fee to use their software, it may require users to pay with their willingness to be subject to data surveillance, as in the case of both Google Sheets and MicrosoftOffice 365. LibreOffice does not collect data on users.*
