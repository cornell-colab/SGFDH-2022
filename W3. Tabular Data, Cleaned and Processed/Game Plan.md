# Tabular Data: Cleaning & Exploring  
  
### Before the Session

* **Download and Install** [OpenRefine 3.5.2](https://openrefine.org/download.html)  
Email Eliza with any problems or questions.  

* **Read** the catalog entries for [Eastern Penitentiary Admission Book A](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/22/) and [Eastern Peniterntiary Admission Book B](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/21/) in *The Magazine of Early American Datasets .*

* **Download the dataset Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv**  
This dataset is a combination of the two datasets that you just read about. 
1. Go to the folder for today's session and click on the link to Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv. A page will open, and you'll see a preview of the data table.  
2. Toward the upper-right, you'll see a button that says "Raw." RIGHT-click it and choose "Save Link As."  
3. Choose a place on your machine to store it. Add the file suffix .csv to the file name if your machine doesn't automatically add it. Download the file and keep it somewhere you can find it Wednesday morning. 

* **Read** Davis, H. (2019). "[A Dataset is a Worldview](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-dataset-is-a-worldview-5328216dd44d)," a blog post on *Towards Data Science*, a *Medium* vertical.  
This short post is about datasets used in machine learning. But the idea that a dataset reflects a worldview is just as relevant to your creation of metadata schema as it is to considering the data used in machine learning, and it should be good food for thought now as well as later.

* **Read** Onouha, M. (2016). "[On Missing Datasets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets)," documentation of a mixed media installation. And **View** [the photos of the installation on the artist's website](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets).  

* **Read** D'Ignazio, C. and L. Klein (2020). "[Chapter 3: What Gets Counted Counts](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/h1w0nbqp/release/3)," in *Data Feminism*, MIT Press.  
Note the brief discussion of *The Colored Conventions Project,* one of the projects I inclduded on Day 1's list of examples.
 

### During the Session  

[Boxnote of questions about the data](https://cornell.app.box.com/notes/819798134709)

### After the Session  
* *Optional* Play around a little more with Open Refine. Try to address (or partially address) some of the research questions in the [boxnotes](https://cornell.app.box.com/folder/164704232818), or use it with your own data. 

* **Post a Reflection**
  - What new questions, insights, or confusions did you generate during or after today's session?
  - In what ways does your own project dataset reflect a worldview of your own, someone else's, or multiple other people's?
  - What are some ways you may want to clean your current project dataset? How confident are you feeling about devising a strategy to do so? What else do you want to learn in order to design, clean, or process your dataset or databse?
