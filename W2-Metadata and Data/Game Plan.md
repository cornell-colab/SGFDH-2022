# SGFDH Day 2: Metadata

### Before the Session 

1. Please bring a hat to the session today *-- BUT -- conceal it until we have our exercise relating to the hats.* (If you do not own a hat, consider borrowing one, or simply bringing any accessory that can be worn on your head.)  The hat might have an origin story that you wouldn't mind sharing in class, or can be completely utilitarian.  Increased diversity of headgear will make this exercise the most meaningful, so the more unusual, the better. 

2. Come to the session with a laptop, and be prepared to share your screen, and to display and discuss a sample of your data for your project. We will be using Clickshare.  

#### Optional Prep Reading

### After the Session

#### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* What metadata might be useful or necessary for you to perform the analysis and/or create the interface that you plan?
* Does your project data include sufficient metadata? What metadata might you need to obtain of create?
* What do you wish you understood better?
* What have you learned today that was or might be especially useful?
