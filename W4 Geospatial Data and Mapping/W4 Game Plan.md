# Geospatial Data

### Before the Session

* **Download and Install** [QGIS (Installer Version 3.22)](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) on your laptop.  
Give yourself a little time to complete the installation -- it takes a few minutes.  
QGIS is a memory hog. If you don’t have a relatively new laptop (QGIS is too bulky for tablets), you can borrow a laptop from the Olin circulation desk for the session. Plan to come to class a little early, so that you'll have enough time to install the software. Youu’ll be able save the files you create and take them home to your desktop.  
**If your laptop is a Mac**, your Mac may tell you it can’t open the QGIS installer because it’s from an unidentified developer. To override these security settings, Go to the system preferences and click "security". Under the general tab you will see a warning towards the bottom of the screen saying something like "[name of program] was blocked from opening". Next to this warning there will be an Open Anyway button. If you click this the installer will open.  

* **Add a plug-in to QGIS**  
  - Open QGIS.
  - Click the top-level menu "Plugins."
  - Choose "Manage and Install Plugins."
  - In the Search bar of the window that pops up, type "QuickMapServices"

  - Click "Install" in the bottom right of the dialog window.

* **Read** Drucker, J. (2011) [Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display](http://www.digitalhumanities.org//dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html). *Digital Humanities Quarterly* 5(1).  
This one is on the longer side. If you don't closely read the whole thing, do make sure to hit the "Space as Spatiality" subsection and the Conclusion.

* **Optional Read** White, R. (2010) "[What Is Spatial History?](https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/media/images/publication/what%20is%20spatial%20history%20pub%20020110.pdf)", published by the Stanford University Spatial History Lab.
