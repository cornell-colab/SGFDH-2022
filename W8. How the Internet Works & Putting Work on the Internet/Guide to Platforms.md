# A Brief Guide to Common Publishing Platforms for Scholarly Work  
  
### [Scalar](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/)
[User’s Guide/Documentation](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/index)  
* Best foor digital narratives with multiple pages and chapters

**Owner/Developer**: The Alliance for Networking Visual Culture (a scholarly association)  
**Hosting**: Free hosting at scalar.usc.edu OR host at your own domain with Reclaim Hosting (See below).  
  
Examples:  
* [Claude McKay’s Early Poetry (1911-1922): A Digital Collection](https://scalar.lehigh.edu/mckay/index) (Amardeep Singh)  
* [A Photographic History of Oregon State University](http://photohistory.oregonstate.edu/works/photo-history/index)(Larry Landis with OSU Digital Publishing)  
This site, unlike the other Scalar examples, is primarily image-based. Note the use of tags and multiple pathways through the exhibit.  


### [Omeka Classic](https://omeka.org/classic/) 

[User Manual / Documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/)  

•	Best for collections of digital objects (images, audio, video) and their metadata.  
•	Also good for creating displays or digital exhibits of your objects. 

Tutorial: [Up and Running with Omeka.net](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka) by Miriam Posner, *The Programming Historian*  (SKIP the part on signing up for Omeka.net.)  
Tutorial: [Creating an Omeka Exhibit](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit) by Miriam Posner & Megan R. Brett, *The Programming Historian*   
  
**Owner/Developer**: Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Washington University.  
**Hosting**: Each Omeka instance must be hosted somewhere. The Cornell CoLab can host it for you for free on our site temporarily OR you can host your instance on your own site and your own domain via Reclaim Hosting (see below).  
(I do **not** recommend is hosting your via Omeka.net, which collects a fee, but does not allow full control of your site and plug-ins.)  

**Examples:**  
* [Wearing Gay History](http://wearinggayhistory.com/) (Eric Gonzaba & Collaborators)
Note that you can browse the entire collection of all the digital items via the “T-shirts” tab, and examine curated exhibits via the “Exhibits” tab.  
* [Japanese Modernism Across Media](https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/japanesemodernism/home) (Students of Bryn Mawr & Haverford Colleges)


### [Juncture](https://juncture-digital.org/)  
 
* Best for illustrated digital essays  
* Quite new 

For documentation, hosting information, and examples, see the link above.

### [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
[User Manual / Documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/)  

•	A general-purpose open-source content management system (CMS) used by many different types of websites.  

**Owner / Developer**: Wordpress Foundation
**Hosting**: Each Wordpress instance must be hosted. You can get free hosting at Wordpress.com, or, for more flexibility and functionality, you can host your own instance on your own domain (see below).  
  
**Examples**

### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
**Documentation:** [Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages), by Amanda Visconti, in _The Programming Historian._  

* Best if you want a very minimalist option that is easy on bandwidth, cheap, and easy to maintain
* Best if you are ech-curious, want to learn digital skills, and don't mind messing around on the commond line, following tutorials, and engaging in trial and error.
* Completely free

**Owner/Developer**  
Jekyll: The Core Jekyll Volunteer Team (Jekyll is open source code.) 
  
  
**Examples**

Note that this site uses the Jekyll static site generator, but is _not_ hosted on GitHub Pages.

These two sites are built using a special flavor of Jekyll for managing digital collections, called [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/):

## Hosting Your Web Site

Wordpress and Omeka are both open-source software that is free to use. However, you will still need a place to *host* your own installation of the software you choose. That means that you need to rent space on someone else's computer (called a server) that will be on all the time and allow users to access your site anytime. 

In most cases, I recommend [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/shared-hosting/). It's designed for scholars, has fantastic technical support, and makes it really easy to install your own instance(s) of Wordpress, Omeka, Scalar, mySQL, and many more platforms. You can also start from scratch and host any HTML, CSS, and/or JS that you write (or borrow/adapt) here. Security and back ups are covered for you. You can register any domain name you like (or move an existing one over). Cost for a personal plan is $30/year (or $45/year if you want your own URL).  

Some useful support tutorials:  
* [Installing Omeka on Reclaim Hosting](https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/installing-omeka-classic-on-reclaim-hosting/193)  
* [Installing PlugIns (like Neatline) on Reclaim Hosting](https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/uploading-plugins-to-omeka/195)
