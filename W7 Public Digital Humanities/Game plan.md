### Optional

The reading for today examines [Photogrammar](https://photogrammar.org/maps) (based at Yale University) as a public digital humanities case study. Peruse the site and consider:
* Who do you think are the intended audiences for this site? Who is the "public" in this public humanities project?
* How do the project creators present their data? How do they point people to the data they use?
* What effect does the project have on you as a user?
