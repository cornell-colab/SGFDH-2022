# The Internet & Digital Public Humanities

## Before the session

### Reading

Cox, Jordana, and Lauren Tilton. ["The digital public humanities: Giving new arguments and new ways to argue."](https://discovery-ebsco-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/linkprocessor/plink?id=4d593ebf-f86c-33c1-b572-6d055b321337) Review of Communication 19.2 (2019): 127-146.  
  
**Read** ["The User, the Learner, and the Machines We Make"](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/) (2015), Alex Gil, from the blog *Minimal Computing.*  

**Optionally Read** ["Minimal Computing in Libraries: An Introduction"](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2017/01/15/mincomp-libraries-intro/) (2016), Stewart Varner, from the blog *Minimal Computing.*  


### Optional

The reading for today examines [Photogrammar](https://photogrammar.org/maps) (based at Yale University) as a public digital humanities case study. Peruse the site and consider:
* Who do you think are the intended audiences for this site? Who is the "public" in this public humanities project?
* How do the project creators present their data? How do they point people to the data they use?
* What effect does the project have on you as a user?

### Part II: Digital Public Humanities

Use this Box note to type up responses to the prompts. We'll discuss your responses together.

If there is issue accessing the Box note, here are the questions:

* Name one purpose for a digital public humanities project.Â 
* From your experience and perspective, what makes an effective digital public humanities project? Consider: What is the project's user interface like? How does the project team engage with public audiences?
* What do you imagine when you think of the word "public"? In the context of your projects, who is the "public" that you'd like to engage?
* Creating a digital project is only one component of digital public humanities. If you're interested in creating a public DH project, how will the "public" you have in mind get engaged to your digital project?
 
 
## After the session 

For your post this afternoon, please consider implications of DH/PH for your own project. Some possible questions to address:  
* Do you anticipate that your project will include a public component either this summer or later on?  
* Did the Cox & Tilton piece, or the discussion about it, spark any thoughts of how you might want to frame or think of your own public-facing work, or how you might understand others'?
* Explore the guide to publishing platforms. Is there one or more you might want to experiment with for your own work this summer? 
* What do you want to understand better?
