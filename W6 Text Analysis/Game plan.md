# Text analysis
Instructor: Iliana Burgos

## Before the session

### Text file

Please bring a text file to class. 
* It can be in any language. 
* If possible, please bring it in plain text format (i.e., a file with the extension .txt) or as a Microsoft Word doc. 

If you're not sure where to download one, try these sites:

* [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
* [Documenting the American South](https://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
* A [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) page of interest (If you choose this option, please just bring the article's URL to class.)

## During the session

Today, we'll explore the tool Voyant to understand a little more about text analysis. We will discuss:
* How to clean up your text file before exploring it in Voyant
* How to create a stopwords list
* Specific tools within Voyant that help us learn about our texts

### Partner activity
With the person next to you (or people, since there will be one group of three), explore your texts in Voyant together. Discuss:
* What texts are each of you using?
* Try out a couple visualization tools. Refer to [Voyant's documentation pages](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/start) to learn more about the tools.
  * What questions do you have as you explore the visualizations?
  * Are the visualizations effective in helping you learn about the texts?
  * What stopwords might help or hinder your exploration of the texts?
  * Overall, do the tools help you learn anything new or unexpected about your texts?
* What is your experience using the platform? Does any aspect of it give you joy, or perhaps frustrate you?

## After the session

### Reflection
I hope you had fun considering approaches to computational text analysis, even if you don't plan on using these methods for your own project this summer. 

After today's session, please consider:
* What was your experience in learning Voyant? What stood out to you as the tool's strengths? What limitations might you have noticed about it?
* What questions emerged as you examined your text file in Voyant? Did a visualization or particular tool interest you?

### Tutorials and further learning

### Tools

<b> Google nGram  </b>

<b> Antconc  </b>

<b> [jsLDA topic modelling tool](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/jslda.html) </b>

This tool helps make topic modelling more accessible as an exploratory method for examining a text corpus. The tool uses Latent Dirilecht Allocation, a statistical model that groups frequently-occurring terms together into clusters. It is written in the programming language JavaScript (hence its name!). 

[jsLDA](https://github.com/mimno/jsLDA) was developed by David Mimno, Associate Professor in the department of of Information Science here at Cornell University. Learn more about the tool in its GitHub documentation pages.
