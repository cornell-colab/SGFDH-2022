# Text analysis
Instructor: Iliana Burgos

## Before the session

### Text file

Please bring a text file to class. 
* It can be in any language. 
* If possible, please bring it in plain text format (i.e., a file with the extension .txt) or as a Microsoft Word doc. 

If you're not sure where to download one, try these sites:

* [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
* [Documenting the American South](https://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
* A [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) page of interest (If you choose this option, please just bring the article's URL to class.)


### Readings

#### Optional

Cottom, Tressie McMillan. (2016) “‘[47. More Scale, More Questions: Observations from Sociology](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/55e48b34-543a-41f7-97c9-8c8643bf8844#ch47)’ in ‘Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016’ on Debates in the DH Manifold.” Debates in the Digital Humanities. 

## During the session

Today, we'll explore the tool Voyant to understand a little more about text analysis. We will discuss:
* How to clean up your text file before exploring it in Voyant
* How to create a stopwords list
* Specific tools within Voyant that help us learn about our texts

### Voyant
Today, we'll use [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org) to explore approaches to computational text analysis.

### Partner activity
With the person next to you (or people, since there will be one group of three), explore your texts in Voyant together. Discuss:
* What texts are each of you using?
* Try out a couple visualization tools. Refer to [Voyant's documentation pages](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/start) to learn more about the tools.
  * What questions do you have as you explore the visualizations?
  * Are the visualizations effective in helping you learn about the texts?
  * What stopwords might help or hinder your exploration of the texts?
  * Overall, do the tools help you learn anything new or unexpected about your texts?
* What is your experience using the platform? Does any aspect of it give you joy, or perhaps frustrate you?

## After the session

### Reflection
I hope you had fun considering approaches to computational text analysis, even if you don't plan on using these methods for your own project this summer. 

After today's session, please consider:
* What was your experience in learning Voyant? What stood out to you as the tool's strengths? What limitations might you have noticed about it?
* What questions emerged as you examined your text file in Voyant? Did a visualization or particular tool interest you?

### Tutorials and further learning

### Tools

<b> [jsLDA topic modelling tool](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/jslda.html) </b>

This tool helps make topic modelling more accessible as an exploratory method for examining a text corpus. The tool uses Latent Dirilecht Allocation, a statistical model that groups frequently-occurring terms together into clusters. It is written in the programming language JavaScript (hence its name!). 

[jsLDA](https://github.com/mimno/jsLDA) was developed by David Mimno, Associate Professor in the department of of Information Science here at Cornell University. Learn more about the tool in its GitHub documentation pages.

<b> [HathiTrust Digital Library Research Center](https://analytics.hathitrust.org) </b>

The HathiTrust Digital Library is a collaborative repository containing over 17.5 million titles (and counting) digitized by academic and research institutions across the U.S., Canada and Europe. HathiTrust Digital Library specializes in literature and U.S. Government document collections. Cornell University is a member institution, which allows Cornell students, faculty and staff to access books and create collections using their own free personal accounts. Creating a collection with the HathiTrust Digital Library is like creating your own text corpus, which can be used for computational text analysis via the HathiTrust Research Center. Collections can be made public for other researchers to access, as well. 

The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) facilitates large-scale computational analysis of the HathiTrust text corpus (including in-copyright materials). Analysis must comply with the Non-Consumptive Use Research Policy.  

HTRC believes that the following text cleaning and analysis techniques are non-consumptive:

* text extraction
* textual analysis and information extraction
* linguistic analysis
* automated translation
* image analysis
* file manipulation
* OCR correction
* indexing and search

The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) Analytics portal features several services for facilitating computational text analysis. There is no cost to accessing the HTRC Analytics portal or exporting the results of analyses. This sets HTRC apart from other service providers that restrict access to texts for computational analyses with paywalls to access their content (e.g., ProQuest's TDM Studio or NewsBank's text mining tool).
